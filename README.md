# üß™ Mergenetic: Evolutionary Model Merging for LLMs
![python 3.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11-blue.svg)


`mergenetic` is a flexible library for merging large language models (LLMs) via **evolutionary optimization**. It frames model merging as a black-box optimization problem and uses techniques like genetic algorithms and smart performance estimators to search for optimal weight combinations ‚Äî enabling high-performance merges, even on consumer hardware.

## üìö Library Submodules Overview

The `src/mergenetic` codebase is organized into modular components that align with different stages of the model merging pipeline:

- `merging/`: Merging logic using `mergekit` (e.g., `SlerpMerger`, `TiesDareMerger`)
- `optimization/`: Problem definitions for `pymoo` (e.g., `CrossLingualMathProblem`)
- `evaluation/`: Fitness function computation
- `estimator/`: Performance evaluators (IRT-based, LM-Eval-Harness-based)
- `searcher/`: Evolution loop orchestration (`Searcher`, logging, testing)
- `utils/`: YAML configs, GPU utilities, loading, etc.

For in depth explanation see `src/mergenetic/readme.md`

## üî¶ TUTORIAL: Cross-Lingual Math Merging

A **tutorial** can be found in the `notebooks/` folder. You will learn how:
- Merge an **Italian LLM** with a **math-specialized model**
- Use SLERP to interpolate their weights
- Evaluate on an **Italian version of GSM8K**

### Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Download models from Hugging Face
2. üìÑ Define a custom task YAML in `mergenetic/lm_tasks/`
3. üß™ Select evaluation anchors from the dataset
4. üîß Configure merging with `ConfigLmEval`
5. ‚öôÔ∏è Define a `SlerpMerger`
6. üîç Instantiate `CrossLingualMathProblem`
7. üßÆ Use `pymoo.GA` as the search algorithm
8. üöÄ Launch `Searcher().search()` and evaluate with `Searcher().test()`

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Mergenetic Usage: three approaches

There are three main approach to use mergenetic:
- Python API
- Command Line Interface
- Graphical User Interface

### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Python API Overview to use Mergenetic:

```python
from mergenetic.searcher import Searcher
from mergenetic.optimization.predefined_problems import CrossLingualMathProblem
from mergenetic.merging import SlerpMerger
from mergenetic.utils import ConfigLmEval

config = ConfigLmEval(**yaml.load(open("path/to/config.yaml"), Loader=yaml.FullLoader))

merger = SlerpMerger(...)
problem = CrossLingualMathProblem(...)
algorithm = GA(...)
searcher = Searcher(problem, algorithm, config.path_to_store_config, config.n_iter, config.run_id, config.seed)

searcher.search()
searcher.test()
```

Here's a concise Markdown guide describing the **four usage types** of `mergenetic.py` based on the combination of:

- **Evaluation method**: `lm-eval` (using LM-Eval Harness) vs `custom`
- **Merge type**: `single` language vs `multi`lingual

Each command launches an interactive CLI that helps configure and optionally launch the experiment.

### ‚å®Ô∏è `mergenetic.py` CLI Usage Guide

`mergenetic.py` supports 4 CLI modes combining `--eval-method` (lm-eval/custom) and `--merge-type` (single/multi):
- üîπ **Single + LM-Eval**: Run merging experiments with standard LM-Eval tasks/metrics.
- üî∏ **Single + Custom**: Use your own dataset (e.g., CSV) for single-language evaluation.
- üåê **Multi + LM-Eval**: Evaluate multilingual merges with LM-Eval Harness.
- üß© **Multi + Custom**: Run multilingual merges with custom data per language.

### üñ•Ô∏è Mergenetic GUI ‚Äî Functionality Overview

The Gradio-based GUI allows users to **configure and launch merging experiments** in an interactive, user-friendly way. It covers the same 4 core scenarios as the CLI:

| Merge Type       | Evaluation Method | GUI Equivalent? | Notes |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------|
| Single Language  | `lm-eval`         | ‚úÖ Yes            | Set "Evaluation Method" to `lm-eval` and "Merging Type" to `single`. |
| Single Language  | `custom`          | ‚úÖ Yes            | Select `custom` and provide a CSV dataset path. |
| Multilingual     | `lm-eval`         | ‚úÖ Yes            | Specify multiple languages and tasks using dropdowns. |
| Multilingual     | `custom`          | ‚úÖ Yes            | Provide separate dataset paths for each language. |
